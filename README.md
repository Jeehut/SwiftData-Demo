## Issues List

- [x] (Fixed in b86bcdb98ed5b2b4f7ae3ab90959f2408615db08) SwiftUI previews crash in `ProfileView.swift`, most probably due to a SwiftData issue
- [x] (Fixed in cbc838640f13a395c7f5dac6711b7eefd5082608) Pressing on the "Sample" profile in the run app opens an editable view, but does not pre-fill it with the profile's data
- [x] (Fixed in 47f02fd7daf2bee2e51bfc3453fd4d9ed2635f9f) Pressing on the "New profile" button, filling the form and pressing "Save" button returns to the list without any new profiles
