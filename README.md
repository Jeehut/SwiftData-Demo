## Issues List

- [x] SwiftUI previews crash in `ProfileView.swift`, most probably due to a SwiftData issue
- [x] Pressing on the "Sample" profile in the run app opens an editable view, but does not pre-fill it with the profile's data
- [x] Pressing on the "New profile" button, filling the form and pressing "Save" button returns to the list without any new profiles
- [x] Even after restarting the app to reload the profiles still doesn't list the new profile, also no error is thrown on save ...
